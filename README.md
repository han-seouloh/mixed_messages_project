# Mixed Messages Portfolio Project: Codecademy

## Description
This is a project where I put to practice what I learned of Javascript syntax in Codecademy. When run, this code outputs a random mixed message from a previously defined pool of adjectives, greetings, etc. depending on the time of day ending with a motivational phrase.

## Features
- Logs a different mixed message depending on the time of day.
- When it is too late at night (defined as between 2AM and 6AM),\n
a message urging the user to sleep is logged.

## How To Use
1. Download the necessary tools to run a Javascript program (node.js is recommended).
2. Once installed run the Javascript program.

## Technologies
- Visual Studio Code: This tool was used to code the Javascript program.
- node.js: This tool allowed to run Javascript programs outside a browser.
- Git: This tool allowed for version control and linking to Github.
